The data should be unzipped in this directory. 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

So the folder structure of the current directory should look something like

/test
/train
activity_labels.txt
features.txt
features_info.txt
README.txt

run_analysis.R contains the script that first reads all the data from the train and test directory and merges them.
